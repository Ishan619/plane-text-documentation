Research on Maine Coon Cats

Maine Coon cats are the one of the most beloved cats by humans. These cats have been on high demand all over the world for past couple
of years, therefore making them one the most popular cat breed in the world. This breed of cats is very ancient where their original
anscestory has been untracable. The recent records approve that they were brought to America back in 1700-1800's, where they first
landed in Maine, and in 1985, they were annouced as an official state cat. They are the models of the cat world whereas, they are also
considered as the dogs of the cat world. Due to their loyalty, affection, intelligence, etc., such traits make them unique compare to
the other cats.

These cats are very big compare to the most domestic cats; the male cats could weight in between 15 to 25 lbs and  the female cats
weight ranges in between 10 to 15 lbs. They are often mistaken for persian cats majority of the time mainly due to their big eyes and
fur. These cats come in many colors, and with unique eye features. Due to their thick fur, these cats could easily survive harsh
winters as they were born to survive any harsh weather except for heavy sun. The paws of these cats are designed to walk on snow and
their ears are extra hairy to protect them from temprature drops as well as water. These cats are easy to train and it is easy for
humans to gain their trust. These cats have no problem interacting with stranger cats, humans, dogs, or any other animals. They are
also refered to as "gentle giants" due to their loving behaviour. They are also very vocal as they produce many  intresting sounds in
order to intract with humans or any other animals; they are most likely to respond back to the humans as they endevour to communicate
with them.

As they gained the title of "best cat", they do have some health issues as they get older. These cats could develop allergies from
plastic bowls, therefore, feeding them from steel or glass bowls is essential. One of the unique features of the Maine coon cats is
that the ones which  inhabit in New England have one or more extra toes compare to the American cats. Though, one with the one or more
toes behave the same as the regular Coon's, yet they are known to run faster than the cats with regular toes due to the pressure
points in their toes, thus, get tired sooner. For the older Coon cats, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common diasease
which they most commonly suffer from. Their cause of death is usually from HCM which eventually causes their heart to fail. Since
these cats have a shape of a rectangle, their hind legs eventually produce blood cloats in their arteries, therefore, causing heart
attack.

Given all the ups and downs, these cats are one of the lovable creatures nature has created. The cats take care of children and are
loyal to their owners where they seek affection all their life. Due to their kittenish features, even when they mature, they usually
get mistaken for looking young. I would defintely buy this cat once I get a job.
